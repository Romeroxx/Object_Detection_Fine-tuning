### Selector

The selector is a Python class implementation of the fine-tuning image selection algorithm used in the thesis work Object Detection Fine-tuning for Computer Vision Applications. The class is build to select fine-tuning images using a pretrained YOLOv5 object detector. It uses the pretrained model to do inference and selects the fine-tuning images according to the results.
